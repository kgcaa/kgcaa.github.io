## The Inception

Heritage is fundamental in creating a “Sense of Pride” for a community considering various aspects related to historical, architectural and cultural significance. Our Alma Mater, the Krishnagar Govt. College, formerly known as Krishnagar College, is one of such “Built Heritage”, founded about 175 years ago, during British Regime, at Krishnagar, Nadia, (W.B.). 

Krishnagar College was founded with the sanction of Lord Hardinge, Governor General of India and formally opened on the 1st January, 1846 for providing “Liberal Education” for the inhabitants of Nadia and neighboring districts of undivided Bengal. It was open to all, irrespective of religion, caste, creed and gender. The foundation of a college at Krishnagar, Nadia is an important event of social, cultural and educational life of public at large. As the Hindu College in Calcutta was established in 1817 for imparting modern education in Calcutta, this Krishnagar College was established to impart Higher Education for Rural Bengal during Mediaeval Life. Both shed new lights on the thinking and way of life of the people and the society. The seeds of modernity showed at Nadia, 100kms away from Calcutta, produced many stalwarts in literature, music, drama, sports and games. Notable personalities of National Freedom, Activists Political and Social Movements, Academicians and Intellectuals came out from this College.

Going back to the annals of history further -  it is seen that after the establishment of Sanskrit College at Benares in 1795, Lord Minto expressed a desire for “setting of two more colleges in Nuddea (Nadia) and Trihoot districts”, in a minute, dated 6th March, 1811.

Macauly penned his famous “Minute of Education” in 1835, which led to a great deal of controversy regarding the fate of oriental education in India. The controversy was set at rest by Lord Bentinck’s Resolution of March1835, which laid down that all funds left after making certain improvements in regard to school of oriental learning should henceforth be employed in imparting knowledge of English Literature and Science through English Language to the native population.

In consonance with the recommendation, the Governor General decided in 1844, to establish at least one Zilla School in each district, subordinate to a Central College of a circle comprised of five districts. With these objectives in view, Bengal was then divided into nine circles of which Krishnagar Circle contained Nadia, Jessore, Burdwan and Bankura districts. A sum of Rs.38,900/- a year was sanctioned in September 1845 for completing the educational programme of Hooghly and Krishnagar Circles. 

The local committee formed for starting the College at Krishnagar was composed of: 

1. Bruce D.J Money (District Magistrate)
2. E.T Travore (Magistrate)
3. Babu Ram Lochan Ghosh (Principal Sadar Amin), who happened to be the father of famous Barristers Monomohan Ghosh and Lalmohan Ghosh.

A scheme formulated by the Local Committee during Lord Hardinge’s Government was approved by the Council of Education. Capt. David Lester Richardson, a renowned Shakespearian Scholar and Ex-Principal of the Presidency Collage, Calcutta, was appointed as the first Principal of the college and as a Secretary of the local committee formally took over the charge on 28th November, 1845. The School and the College were then one institution and the first combined staff of the institution was the Principal, three European Masters (Messers Bradbury, Beatson and Beanland) and ten Indian teachers of whom the two most illustrious were Pandit Madan Mohan Tarkalankar and Babu Ramtanu Lahiri.

After the start of the college, the Local committee met on 11th February, 1846, to select a suitable site for the college and draw up a plan for building of a college for 500 students. A plot of land of over 36 Acres (100 bighas) area, at a prime location of the city was selected. The selected land is bounded by roads on the West, South and East sides and Northern side by extension of Anjana River and two big Nilkuthis. 

The two-thirds of the selected land was donated by Maharaja Shrish Chandra Roy of Nadia and Maharani Swarnamoyee Devi of Cossimbazar and on persuasion by Hon’ble Mr. Bethune, an Indigo Planter Mr. Hill sold a plot of land of area over 33 bighas with a Bunglow to the college authority at the price of Rs. 6,000/-. The fund for the land was raised by public donations. Messrs Burn & Co. drew up the plan of the College Building.

A picturesque, majestic and inspiring building was erected on over 3 bighas of land at the central position of the selected land, at a cost of Rs. 66,876/-  - of which Rs. 17,000/- was from public donations. The rest of the fund came from East India Company set aside for education of the native population.

The construction of the buildings was completed by May, 1856 and the college was shifted to the new building on 2nd June, 1856 from its erstwhile rented house located at Hatarpara, Krishnagar.

Space was left for a wide flower garden in front of the main building; and beyond that - three playgrounds were symmetrically positioned to cater the needs of the students. In the open space in front of the building, many trees of various types - typical and of rare species were planted for the beautification of the entire campus and to ensure Pollution free atmosphere.

During its inception, the college compound was fenced completely with barbed wire on concrete pillars. Handsome, tall and majestic big pillars were erected at the entrance of four gateways in 1860. The pillar on the western gateway and one in the eastern gateway still remain in the original position. But the devastating cyclone in October 1867 and the great earthquakes of 1897 damaged the other pillars. The college compound, with these elements, assumed a special look different from the rest of the city. 

As a result, the teachers, students and general public of the town looked at the college compound with a sense of awe, wonder and respect. To them all, the entire college compound was a sacred place.  

The panoramic view with imposing building with vast surroundings, decorated with flower garden, playgrounds and trees created a serene and tranquil atmosphere conducive to academic pursuit and fostering aesthetic sense in the blooming mind of the students and helped lessening their stress and strain with fresh air. 

As regards the architecture of the palatial main building of the college, it is a NEO-CLASSICAL ARCHITECTURE (sometimes confused with Roman Architecture) and has striking similarities with Raj Bhawan of Kolkata, if viewed from the North Gate. The frontal portico of the building is surrounded by a colonnaded verandah accessed by flights of grand steps. The plan allows a great deal of natural ventilation with very high ceiling for all the rooms, while also permitting views across the gardens. The other two building occupied by the college were erected during the year of 1879 – 80 and 1917-18, respectively.

However, in the course of century the building suffered great damage for the first time by a devastating cyclone in October, 1864 and again by the great earthquakes of 1897. The damages could be restored with effective initiatives of the citizens and the Administration. 

Although the college could broadly withstand the vagaries of nature over such a long period of time, it could not stop huge environmental degradation caused due to felling of a large number of trees of more than 150 years old by timber mafia, un-authorized encroachment and illegal constructions within and outside the College Walls, mostly patronized by interested agencies and due to indifferent and permissive attitude of the Local Administrations.

## The Past and Present of Krishnagar Govt. College, Nadia: History of Foundation
> By D.N. Biswas M.Sc., Ph.d. (Cal) (an ex-student (1955 to 1959) and a former teacher (1962 to 1976 and 1987 to 1998) of the college

Krishnagar Govt. College started functioning from 1st January, 1846. Its original namewas Krishnagar College. The foundation of a college at Krishnagar, Nadia, is an important eventof social, cultural, educational life of medieval rural Bengal as the establishment of Hindu Collegein 1817 in Calcutta Society. The activities of teachers and taught taughts of Hindu College shook theCalcutta Society and shed new light on the thinking and way of life of the people of Calcutta,particularly of the forward looking people of Calcutta Society. Similarly Krishnagar College broughtfresh air and new light in the age-old belief and social customs of rural life and injected slowlymodernity in the thinking and activities of upper crust of rural society far away from Calcutta. Andsowed the seeds of modern Arts, Literature, Science and Culture in Nadia and adjoining districts.As a result there emerged many stalwart persons in literature, music, drama, sports and games.The process of emergence of modernity in the area started with the involvement and efforts oflocal people for establishing a college at Krishnagar for modern education; as the history offoundation of Krishnagar.College bears testimony of advanced thinking, selfless contributions,sincere efforts made by the public in general and leading personalities of Nadia in particular for thefoundation of Krishnagar College in order to uplift the society through modern education. Theirmission became successful to a greater extent. History of foundation of Krishnagar Collegebears also the testimony how in olden days the public institutions were established and maintained by close co-operation of public participation and involvement of the Govt. in contrast withthe present practice followed in the development works after independence.Long before the foundation of Krishnagar College Thomas Fisher, a Searcher of old recordsat East India Company House came across an old Minute dated March, 1811 where it wasmentioned that after the establishment of Sanskrit college at Banaras in 1792 Lord Minto expressed desire for setting two more colleges in Nuddea and Trihoot districts. A committee wasalso formed to implement the plan. But the committee did nothing except preparing a report onthe State of Education in Nadia. The report contained the facts that there were 46 schools withabout 380 students of ages 25 to 35 years. The Government made further enquiries but no replywas received. So the plan was abandoned. Thomas Fisher compiled these facts into a Memoirin 1827. He added to his Memoir a supplement in which he mentioned that there were 25 toleswhere instruction was free. The Pandits received funds and grants from the Raja of Nadia andpresents from Jaminders. The number of students in a tole was about 20 to 25. They were fullgrown men. The subject of studies was Nyaya or Logic.The supplement along with Memoir was placed before the Select Committee of House ofCommons on the affairs of East India Company as Minutes of evidence (Feb. to July 1832); butnothing came out of it before Ld. Bentink.Lord Bentink decided in March 1835 that all funds left after making improvement of schoolsfor oriental studies would be employed in imparting knowledge of English Literature and Scienceto the native population through English language. The Council of Education was formed forspeedy implementation of the resolution.  The Council of Education explore the possibilities of starting schools and colleges invarious zones and formed local committees at different areas and with the help of local commit-tees a number of colleges were established over the period 1835 to 1836 -- Medical College atCalcutta and Patna College in 1835 and Hooghly College and Dhaka College in 1836 only forHigher Education. In the foundation of these institutions emphasis was laid rather on higher thanon popular education which Macaulay stressed in his minutes of February 1835. ln the laterperiod institutions were set up on the basis of recommendation made by Lord Auckland in 1839who pointed out to the General Committee of Public Instruction (appointed in 1823) the necessityfor rendering higher instruction efficient in a certain number of central colleges rather than founding ordinary Zilla School. In consonance with the recommendation, Governor General decided in 1844 to establisha Zilla School in each district sub-ordinate to a central college of a circle of 5 districts. With thisobjective in view the then Bengal was divided into nine circles of which Krishnagar Circle con-tained Nadia, Jessore, Burdwan and Bankura and a sum of Rs. 38900.00 a year was sanctionedin September 1845 for completing the educational programme in Hooghly and Krishnagar Circles.The Government also issued an order for foundation of a College at Krishnagar in Nadia andCirculated a General notification in English and Bengali on the 1st October 1845 throughout thedistricts of Nadia, Howrah, Barasat, East and West Burdwan for admission to the college from1st November 1845. The notification informed that pupils of any religion or caste below 16 yrs. ofage would apply for admission to the local committee formed immediately after the issuance theorder for formation of a college at Krishnagar, Nadia.

### The other information contained in the notification

i. The Course of study would be the same that pursued at the Hindu College at Calcutta and College of Md. Mahasin at Hooghly; ii) the objective of providing education in the college would be to advance the moral and intellectual conditions of the people and to ﬁt them for taking an adequate part in the administration of public affairs and m) scholarships available on the basis
of performance in the Annual Examination.

The Local Committee formed for starting a college at Krishnagar was composed of:
1. Bruce D.J. Money (District Magistrate)
2. E.T. Travor (Magistrate)
3. Babu Ram Lochan Ghosh (Principal Sadar Amin), who happened to be the father of a famous Barrister Mono Mohan Ghosh and Lal Mohan Ghosh.

A scheme formulated by the local committee during Lord Hardinge's Government wasapproved by the Council of Education. Captain D.L. Richardson was appointed as the 1st Principal of Krishnagar College and as a secretary to the Local Committee. The local committeeconvened a public meeting on 18th November, 1845 at Krishnagar for raising funds for construction of College Building. in the meeting donations of Rs. 13,000/- was raised and that Rs. 7,000 or more was expected from wealthy residents of the district who could not attend the meeting. Theproceedings of the meeting was published in the contemporary paper The Friend of India on 27thNovember, 1845 at page 754.Captain D. L. Richarson took over charge on the 28th Nov. 1845 and 1st meeting of theLocal Committee was held on Dec. 6, 1845 for drawing up a detailed proposals for appointment ofstaff and renting of a house of Hari Mohan Mukherjee (of Kalighat, Calcutta) near Main PostOfﬁce, Krishnagar with extensive grounds covering about one hundred bighas at a monthly rent ofRs. 125. The Govemment approved the proposals. The Local Committee met again on 31st Dec.1845 and resolved "Krishnagar College shall be open tomorrow, the 1st January, 1846. The College started as combined institution of school and college as Junior and Seniorsections with provisions for 13 free studentships. The staff members other than Principal werethree European Masters and ten Indian teachers two of them Pandit Madan Mohan Tarkalankarand Babu Ramtanu Lahiri were very illustrious. At the start roll strength was 246 of which onlyeight students were in the college section. The college was open to all inhabitants of Nadia andadjoining districts irrespective of religion or caste. In this respect the founding fathers of KrishnagarCollege were more progressive and pioneer in spreading education among all people irrespectiveof their religion or caste than those of Hindu College. The event of admission of a son of a famousnautch of the Calcutta city to Hindu college brewed up a serious turmoil in the college. The falloutof the crisis led to the separation of the school and college as Hindu School and PresidencyCollege in 1857. Krishnagar College retained its name till 1976 whereafter the college is beingknown as Krishnagar Govt. College. The school section was seperated as Krishnagar CollegiateSchool in 1908 to accommodate more classes for new courses. 

After the start of the college the local committee met on 11 Feb. 1846. The meeting authorised the committee to select a suitable site for the college and to draw up a plan for building of a college of 500 students. A plot of land of over 100 bighas area at a prime location ofthe city was selected. The selected land is bounded by roads on west, south and east sides and north side by extension of Anjana and two big nilkuthis. The two third of the selected land wasdonated by Maharaja Srish Chandra Roy of Nadia and Maharani Swarnamoyee of Kasimbazar;and on pursuation by Hon‘ble Mr. Bethun an Indigo Planter Mr. Hill sold a plot of land of area over33 bighas with a Bunglow to the college authority at the price of 6 thousand. The fund for the land was raised by public donations. Messrs. Burn & Co. drew up the plan of the college building. A picturesque, handsome and imposing building was erected over 3 bighas of land’ at the central position of the selected land. The building was erected at a cost of Rs. 66876.00 of whichRs. 17,000.00 was public donation and the rest came from fund of East India Company set aside for education of native population. The construction of building was completed by May 1856 andthe college was shifted to the new building on 2nd June, 1856. A big ﬂower garden and beyond it two grounds were set‘ symmetrically. In the open vast space in front of the building many trees of various types, typical and rare, were planted to ‘decorate the entire compound. The college compound was enclosed completely with barbed wire on concrete pillars and handsome tall andmajestic big pillars were erected at the entrance of four gate ways in 1860. The pillar’ on the western gateway and one in the eastern gateways still remain in their original positions. Thedevastating cyclone in October 1867 and great earth quake of 1897 damaged the other pillars. 

The college compound with majestic building, flower garden, vast open space with grown up trees of various types,‘ scattered all over the compound assumed a special look different from rest of the city." As a result, the teachers, students and general public of the town looked at thecollege compound with a sense of awe, wonder and respect. To them all, college compound wasa sacred place. The visitors used to stand and stare at the panoramic view of the college com-pound with wonder and reverence. - The imposing building with vast surrounding decorated withflower garden, play grounds and trees created a serene and tranquil natural environment conduciveto academic pursuit and fostering aesthetic sense in the blooming mind of the students and ithelped lessening the stress and strain of the minds of the teachers and students alike. Thecollege enjoyed such esteemed position till the end of the 6th decade of last century among thepeople of the town. Thereafter the college started loosing its charm due to various reasons whichwould be mentioned in proper context.

## Growth of the College
The process of growth is a continuous one. Krishnagar College too grew gradually butwith ups and downs due to natural calamities and political movements. The local Committee ranthe college for two and a half years after its establishment and handed over the overall management to the Council of Education on 2nd June, 1848. The Council retained the control of the  college till 1st January, 1855 when the function of the Council delved upon the Director of Public Instructions, Bengal. 

From the start the classes of Junior section were conducted for Junior Scholarship Examination and classes of Senior Section for Senior Scholarship Examination. The class examinations were conducted strictly to the nominee, Maharaja Srish Chandra Roy himself took a personal interest and examined most of the classes in Bengali in the Annual Test. Out of the 19 students in the Senior section 17 sat for the Senior Scholarship examination in 1849. One of the examinees Mr. Umesh Dutta topped the list of all Senior Scholars of Bengal. Later on Mr. Dutta became a renowned English Scholar and the member of the Imperial Education Service (IES). The school section had eight classes of roll strength 246. The inspiring teachings of the teachers, particularly of Babu Ramtanu Lahiri, a student and follower of Dirozio made the students progressive in outlook. When the question of remarriage of Hindu widow became a public issue in Bengal, the students of Krishnagar College came forward to take a solemn oath at a stormy meeting in the college to fight for the cause of widow of the country. Noted educationist 
Mr. D. Bethune and two other distinguished members of Council of Education attended the Annual Prize
Ceremony on 20th February, 1849. Mr. Bethune gave stirring address to the students and exhorted
them not only to educate them but to become disseminators of knowledge and learning among
people. He came also on another occasion and appealed to the public of Nadia to take up the
cause of education of women and to give them their legitimate place in the society. Thus Krishnagar
College became not only a centre of modern education but also a centre of social reform for the
area. The students of Krishnagar College were also involved in the religious and social movements of Bramho Samaj. Thus with a progress of education in the college social awareness grew
gradually among the people of Nadia. Centering the college the, promotion of social consciousness of the people continued to grow till the advent of Non-co-operation movement from 1921
when social movements were replaced by political movements. How it affected the academic life
of the college would be mentioned later on. The progress in education in Krishnagar College was
seriously disturbed at different times due to devastating cyclone in 1864 and great earth quake of
1897 and out break of Malaria in 1871 in the epidemic form in the adjoining areas. But such was
the intensity of love of the public for the college that the academic life was restored to its normal
condition almost immediately by the selfless help of the people of Nadia and the college moved
ahead again with time.
 
After the foundation of Calcutta University in 1857, the Junior and Senior Scholarship
examinations were replaced by Entrance and F.A. (First Arts) examinations of Calcutta University. The B.A. and Law classes were introduced in 1865, the teaching of MA course in 1870 and
Survey Department were opened in August 1873. University made Chemistry a compulsory
Science subject in the F.A. course in 1873. So the teaching of Chemistry got special importance
in the college from the next year.
 
Krishnagar College sent up 13 students for F.A. examination in 1862 and 5 students for B.A. Examination in 1867 as first batch. 9 students were successful in F.A. and 2 in B..A. examinations. The first graduates from Krishnagar College were Mr. Jadunath Mukherjee and
Jadunath Bhattacharya. 7 students sat for B.L. Examination in'1872 and 6 were successful. In
1874 Mr. P.N. Bose occupied 5th place in order of merit in F.A. examination. He later on became
famous scientist and discovered Iron Ores in Jamshedpur area. The college roll strength rose to
127. But due to outbreak of malaria in 1871 in epidemic form in the area, students remained
absent in the college and the B.A. classes were abolished. The college thereby reduced to 2nd
Grade. This step generated resentment among the people of Nadia. The public of Nadia donated
over Rs. 40,000.00 with which the college Endowment Fund was created and the fund was
invested in Government Securities in 1878 with a condition for restoration of the-college to its First '
Grade status. The Lieutenant Governor Sir Richard Temple paid a visit the college and restored
B.A. classes. '
 
 
The college course included both Arts and Science subjects and students were allowed
to take up a course combination of History and Logic with Chemistry, physics or Mathematics
and even allowed Honours in combined course in Chemistry and Physics. To meet the growing
demands for Science subject College laboratory was set up in 1880 and a separate building was
erected in 1904 for Chemistry. The brilliant results in B.A. and F.A. examinations over 1682 to
1904 enhanced the reputation of the college. Mr. Lalit Kumar Banerjee stood ﬁrst in F.A.; poet
D.L. Roy passed F.A. with scholarship and Mr. Satish Ch. Dey Acharya stood second in Sanskrit
in B.A. He afterwards became Principal of Sanskrit College, Calcutta.
 
By this time Calcutta University promulgated new rules and regulations in 1907 for college education. The new rules and regulations demanded overhauling of colleges. Mr. Jackson
was appointed as special officer to overhaul the Govt. Colleges. He separated the Collegiate
School from the college in January, 1908; abolished M.A. and B.L. classes. Affiliations for I. Sc.
& B.Sc. courses were obtained; introduced Hons’ in English and Mathematics and Pass courses
in Economics and Philosophy. A Governing body with District Judge as Ex. Officio President was
constituted of and staff council was introduced. The conditions of Library and Laboratories were
improved. New trust funds with individual donations were created - three free studentships in1916
and students Aid fund in 1929 were introduced by levying one anna per student per month. The
college Magazine appeared First in 1908 under the name ‘Life and Light’ in manuscript form and
printed form in 1915 ‘College Magazine’.
 
The students‘ common room appeared in 1905. College Union started its career with
common room activities. Later on 1937 Social, Athletic, Study Circle and Common Room
activities were entrusted with elected office bearers of the students in order to develop leadership
and social spirit among the students. Within a few years students showed their usual interest in
Social and Literary activities. During such reorganizing process came the thrust of Non-co-operation Movement in 1921 on the college life and the discipline in the college was broken down.
College remained closed for nearly a month. But for the people resentment and the report of
Principal Eegarton Smith reaffirming the usefulness of the college for Nadia people in 1922; the
college was again reopened. Principal Smith's involvement with the cause and dignity for the
college was legendary. He prevented a British D.M. from practicing horse riding on the college
play ground on the ground of damage of the surface of the play ground. Principal Smith also
prevented a Police officer from arresting a freedom fighter from college hostel where the freedom
fighter took shelter as a guest of a student to preserve sanctity of the college.
 
Again from 1925 onwards many changes in appearance and in inner life of the college
were witnessed. The college Hindu Hostel opened in June, 1876 came to a new Building in 1927.
The Muhammadan Hostel started in July 1915 came to Anderson Moslem Hostel opened by Sir
Azizul Haque in July, 1936. The college buildings was fitted with electricity in 1936.
 
Co-education in the college was started in 1932 with one female student who was a
daughter of Principal R.N. Sen and rose gradually to 46 in 1945. The student strength in general
also rose to 450 with 90 Moslem students. The principals who made great contributions to the
development of the college were Mr. Rochfort (Dec. 1846 to Dec. 1855), Sir Roper Lethbridge
(1 B74-1877), Rai Bahadur Jyoti Bhusan Bhaduri (1898-1906), Mr. Satish Ch. Dey (1909-1916),
Mr. R.N. Gilchrist(1916-1921)and Principal J.M. Sen. He (Principal Sen) improved the college in
many directions. He got new affiliations in Civics in LA‘, Arabic in l.A. & B.A. Pass Course;
Bengali Pass and Hons’ in Economics. Additional section in B.Sc. Pass course was opened.
For teaching of Biology in l.Sc. course the construction of a building was started in 1941-1942
which was completed before 1946-1948 session. Principal Sen introduced annual college Sports,
annual college Dramatic performance and Old Students reunion with its crowded programme of
amusements, matches. As a result Krishnagar College attended the status of a Premier Educa-
tional lnstitution in the area by 1940 and remained so till 1972. Before that time promising
students from distant places bee‘-lined in the college for admission.
 
 
Activities of the college union continued to enrich the corporate life of the institution in the
later years up to 1972. Principal Sen arranged the centenary celebration with approval of the
Governing body of the college on 14th January, 1946 in a befitting manner. He raised in the
centenary year a sum of over Rs. 60,000.00 in Government Promissory note and cash from friends,
well wishers and old students for creation of endowments for two scholarships, 16 stipends and
a fair number of prizes and medals to encourage poor but meritorious students at Krishnagar
college. He also collected sponsorship for construction of a pavilion on the college ground in the
centenary year at the cost of Rs. 10,000/- of which Rs. 8,000.00 was donated by a business man
Seth Bhagaban Das alone. Thus by public and Government participation and co-operation Krishnagar
college grew into a premier institution for all out development of the students and the college
fulfilled that mission up to 1972.
 
In the centenary celebration report, the public contributions and co-operations have duly
been recognised - "The labour of many teachers and public men of Nadia has gone into the
making of the institution. May their example of unselfish service ever inspire the youths of Krishnagar
in years to come and make them worthy of their rich heritage." . In this context the message sent
by the Syndicate of Calcutta University is note worthy ‘
 
“The University of Calcutta offers its most cordial greetings and felicitations to the
Krishnagar College on the occasion of its Centenary Celebration. The University
recalls with pleasure and gratification the great role which the college has played in
the advancement of learning in the province, through its eminent Principals and
teachers of whom Capt. D.L. Richardson was the first and also through its alumni
among whom are some of the famous sons of Bengal. The University hopes and
trusts that the noble efforts of the College for the advancement of learning will be
crowned with ever increasing success as they have been in the past."
 
But age old tradition of public participation in the development of the college was discontinued after independence. Thereafter the affairs of the college became the sole business of the
Government officials and the name of the college was accordingly changed to Krishnagar Government College; perhaps to imbrue the mind of present generation with the idea that Krishnagar
College is not a college of the people of Nadia but purely of Government institution to be looked
after by the Government officials alone.
 
The consequence of snapping the age-old relation of the public with college proved
disastrous on many accounts. First the college was not developed in the direction set forth in the
centenary year when it was declared that the college would be further developed to cater to the
educational needs of all the communities inhabiting the district. For such purpose it was pro-
posed that the basic science subjects in Agriculture, Forestry, Fishery should be provided by
Science Departments at College and practical training by Government Agricultural, Fishery Farms
and Horticultural garden. But the college was developed in a direction not in conformity with the
proposal. Secondly the public involvement helped much in restoring the college rapidly from
disorder in the growing period of the college ; on the contrary due to lack of public participation in
the later period the college could not yet recouped degradation of its academic discipline and
atmosphere, loss of land and building for want of public help and the 150th anniversary celebration
was a stale affair of the officials of district and higher education departments. As there was no
scope for public participation in any manner as it was in the centenary celebration, nothing
memorable was added to the life of the college in 150th anniversary. Whereas centenary of
college was celebrated in January, 1946 in befitting manner with participation of people of all
walks of life. They donated generously over Rs. 87600.00 for scholarships, stipend, prizes,
medals and for a pavilion on the play ground. The donors were of wealthy individuals to common
people, trading communities (Marawary Association, Alamdanga; Bengalee Merchant Association, Seth Bhagaban Das), companies (Renwick & Co., Kusthia; Ramnagar Cane and Sugar Co.
Ltd.; Darsana Sugar Mill) Community e.g. Beel Resha Dhibar Samity; staff and students of
schools, e.g. M.E. School, Kurulgachhi. The donations were in the range of Rs. 15,000.00 to Re. 1.
The collection of fund was in excess of requirement. The fund in excess was deposited as
Krishnagar College Fund which remained unutilised till 1993. Thereafter a major part (over Rs.
1,78,000/-) of the accumulated amount has been withdrawn and used for what purposes is not
clear to anybody else. Here lies real difference between the development of the college by joint
participation of Government Officials and public and without public. The main motto of the officials
is to manage the situation somehow without considering spirit and importance of it and how to get
better posting or promotion.
 
### Introduction of new courses and the associated problems
 
Despite the radical change of outlook of the college authority after independence the
college continued to function with the same spirit for al Jut development of the students under full
care and guidance of Principal and Teachers. The spree of education and enlightenment through
vigorous class teaching, sports and games, debate and discussions, music and dramatic performances continued as usual unabated till 1972 and Honours courses in Chemistry and Physics
were introduced in 50s and 60s; Botany and Zoology in eighties of last century after proper
development of the infrastructural facilities. The normal rhythm of academic and cultural life in the
college were suddenly disturbed and began to disappear gradually day to day due to continuous
onslaught on the tranquil and natural environment of the college in an unusual law and order
situation prevailing in the town and for a notion of derision to government property developed
among a section of political minded people after food movement in 1966 onwards and as a result
removing of beautifying elements of the college compounds and buildings became a rampant
activities of inner and outer miscreants. The charm of the college compound thereby began to
wane in a fast pace.
 
In the middle of eighties of last century pass course in Statistics was introduced without
developing any specific infrastructure for the course. As a result classes are being held here and
there as per availability of spare rooms in the college. In the first part of nineties Honours course
and a few years later post graduates course in Geography were introduced without development
of infrastructure for them by suddenly occupying newly renovated original chemistry building
erected in 1904 exclusively for Chemistry Department with special attention for ceiling-height,
ventilation and water drainage on the floors. The renovation was initiated by the department of
Chemistry for mitigation of space problem with special permission from higher authority of P.W.D.
whose local authority did everything for demolition of the building. The building was taken over for
Geography while resetting the desks (over 70 in number) in students’ practical room, research
laboratory and in lecture theatre for demonstration of experiments had been going on with valuable plants obtained by processing over 25 long and medium size voluminous Kari (Beam) and
Barga of Burma Teak set free by recasting the entire roof of the building with reinforced concrete.
As a result of sudden taking over, a huge volume of Plants of Burma Teak and large number of
porcelain sinks and basins were lost and the Dept. of Chemistry became handicapped due to
shrinkage of space. The taking over of the building was opposed by the Dept. of Chemistry as
well as by the Staff Council of the College. Later on the Gas Plant was demolished for releasing
the valuable fittings. The plant if retained would have been an exhibit of science and technology
for the students and people alike. Here it may be mentioned that department of Chemistry
brought much glory to the college due to research activities and Honours teaching.
 
The research activity in the department of Chemistry was initiated by Dr. Suresh Chandra
Sengupta before independence and continued till middle of sixth decade of last century. He
himself got D.Sc. from C.U. and his work became world famous as Bardhan-Sengupta Synthesis
as it is considered as the precursor of Hormone Synthesis much required in Fishery, forestry,
 
 
agriculture, horticulture, and in medicine. Dr. Sengupta guided also two teachers who obatined
Ph.D. from C.U. Along with them two more teachers under the guidance of two teachers of
Science College, Calcutta carried out research in the same laboratory and got one teacher D.Sc.
and other Ph.D. All of them except Dr. Sengupta proceeded abroad with Postdoctoral fellowship
of Western Universities. The students passed with Honours in Chemistry from the college have
also occupied place of honour in Schools, Colleges, Universities, Atomic Energy Organisation
and in Government and Non-Government Organisations at home and abroad as teachers and
scientists. But who cares for achievement of the department but for personal interests. The
achievements of Physics Department are of the same level except research culture.
 
Other notable changes that were introduced in the college are the discontinuation of
posts of professors in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Economics and in Sanskrit introduced
first in the 1st part of 7th decade of last century ; snapping of age-old relationship of the college
with the University of Calcutta established at the very inception of the university due to reorganisation
of the colleges under Calcutta University. At the very start of 21st Century, postgraduate courses
in Geography, Philosophy and in Bengali were introduced in the college without expanding the
infrastructure of the college simply by abolishing the Higher Secondary Courses and appointing a
few part-time teachers in the vacant posts to mitigate partially the teaching load of the regular
teachers.
 
Over this period the college gradually lost not only its material wealth but also its inner
strength i.e. student - teacher ratio and discipline were being diminished and academic processes such as admission, class promotion, conduct of examinations, sending of students for
university examinations lost to greater extent their significance and purpose and became mere
rituals. On the other hand co-curricular activities for which Krishnagar College had a prominent
position among the colleges of West Bengal became non-existent. The social and cultural
activities nurtured through debate, discussion, recitation, extempore speeches, music and drama,
games and sports practices and class competitions under active guidance of the teachers were
discontinued gradually from 1972 onwards. Thus college from 1972-onwards began to lose
everything essential for standard education for all out development of human beings and became
a centre for earning mere degrees. In that period the college lost its beautifying elements and the
compound began to lose its charms and tranquil atmosphere due to intense political movements
over the period 1972-1975. The contact of the local people with the college was completely lost;
academic devotions and urges for cultural activities of the students stooped to the lowest which in
turn inevitably led to the fall of standard of not only education but of other essential elements
required for good education in the college.
 
### Degradation and Sacrilege
 
It has already been pointed out that the extremist movement over the period 1972-1975
and heavy influx of vast number of people from erstwhile East Pakistan, now Bangladesh in the
area brewed up crisis in the academic and cultural life in the college. Of course political trouble
started in the town with the students‘ food movement in 1966 for Kerosene and Rice at fair prices.
Under the combined influence of extremists movements and heavy influx of people law and order
situation in the town broke‘ down heavily and every one suffered from sense of insecurity. Under
the spell of insecurity the original inhabitants of the town lost their special urge for cultural activities in Arts, Literature, Sports and Games, Drama and Music for which Krishnagar had a special
reputation in the cultural world and gradually became involved in current politics. This degrading
trend in cultural activities in the town and the sense of insecurity cast their shadows on the
academic and cultural life in the college. Under the spell of abnormal situation in the town,
activities in the college became limited to mere class teachings; even that too began to be held
irregularly as teachers left their messes and began to commute from distant homes. The students also left their hostels as at that time they thought living in the hostel was not safe for them.
 
Few promising boys of the college lost their lives in the movement and college office was ran-
sacked. The college looked deserted long ahead of the closing hour. Under the clout of fear and
insecurity the moral and administrative authority of the Principal and the Teachers lost its importance and significance essential for shaping the academic and cultural life in the college and
never recovered again to its original state even when normalcy returned in the area. As a result all
activities in the college other than class teachings became mere rituals without spirit and significance. Two important processes, admission and sending of students for University examinations
could not be carried out as per norms from 1972 onwards.
 
The extremists at that time spread hatred against the current education. As a result the
college began to lose its inner wealth --the discipline, students' earnestness and love for education and urge for cultural activities and academic interest to a greater extent. On the contrary a
section of the students, particularly of low and medium merits imbibed mentality for real politics
as they were in thinking that political activity would be more beneficial to them in life than devoted
pursuit of education. The students of such mentality became very much active in every sphere of
college life and became trouble maker and in fact later on they began to control admission and
sending of students for university examinations. Some students of this section of educationally
ill-equipped emerged later on as political leaders of various category. During that period some
teachers too began to feel that the political linkage to a party would be more gainful in life than
dedicated and sincere service. In fact some of them, not all, gained in service but all of them were
deprived of satisfaction and prestige of dedicated service. Through such politically motivated
students and teachers the political persons stepped into the affairs of the college and were
getting invitations in the college functions in preference to prominent educationist.
The combinations of these factors derailed the normal academic life prevailed so long in
the college and trouble and disturbances became not rare but frequent affairs. The trouble and
disturbances could not be tackled by moral authority alone. Consequently college authority from
that period onwards became heavily dependent on general administration whose help was not
required at all before the extremists movements. The general administrations took full advantage
of this situation disregarding the academic interest and dignity of the college.
 
In abnormal situation the activities of the insider and outsider miscreants became ram-
pant. They took away all the beautiful cast iron railings fitted in between the majestic pillars on
the Varandah of the main building and all the lightning arresters fitted on the top of the main
building and looked like a crown on it. The students and teachers noticed with astonishment on
the reopening day after a Puja Vacation that all the beautiful spherical brass knobs fitted in the
majestic doors for opening, closing and locking them had been replaced by iron rings and beautiful brass chains in the form of twisted Creepers with foliage and flowers of the College Hall were
replaced by iron tubes. On the occasion of functions and lectures by distinguished speaker all
the lights were on, and the scattered light made the foliage and flowers glittering which created a
special environment in the college Hall. Sand stone flooring tiles were removed from Varandah
and from some of the rooms of the main building and the floor was cemented which in a short
period assumed the look of a stable floor and the heritage character of the building was lost.
Similarly beautifully coloured Italian marble tiles were removed from some of the rooms of Krishnagar
Collegiate School building shortly after independence. The building was once the residence of
famous Barristar Manmohan Ghosh. There is a rumour that the house was sold to the Government on the condition that nothing in the building could be removed. This is not all; many other
articles were lost in this period from the college. Cast iron retorts, weights on gas plant and even
coal were being stolen off and on at that time. As a result gas supply in the Chemistry Department was stopped and practical classes were being conducted with the help of Kerosene stoves
and spirit lamps over a long period. At the same time college garden was being ransacked by
breaking blooming branches and uprooting flowering plants from the beds, removing barks of
 
some of the permanent flowering plants. As a result the charms of the college compound were
lost gradually which once was so beautiful that Prof. Binayak Sanyal published a book on the
college compound. But from the same compound in the first half of 90s, some valuable old and
partially damaged timber trees were stolen in the darkness of night in quick succession. The l.B.
dept. was perplexed and carried out enquiry and sent report to the Higher Education Secretary,
W.B., Government. What action, if any, was taken is not known to the others.
 
The college play grounds were also being damaged by holding of frequent political meetings 
and trade fairs on the college grounds from eighties onwards. As a result of these the
college building and its compound lost their beauty, charm and tranquility, maintained over long
period by foreign rulers and public of Nadia. From eighties a new form of onslaught began to
come from Government officials of various departments. They tried to solve their departmental
problems at the cost of the college. In the thirties of the last century the demand for hostel
accommodation increased greatly and a second hostel was opened in a nearby Nilkuthi on rental
basis. Once Sir William Jones, the founder of Asiatic Society, Calcutta, used to stay there
occasionally for translation of Sanskrit literature into English with the help of Pandits of Nabadwip.
Before leaving the place foreover the owner of the Nilkuthi offered the Kuthi with its surrounding
land to the Principal with whom the owner had a good rapport to purchase the house. He sold his
Bungalow to a teacher of the College. The British Principal accepted the offer and purchased the
property at a nominal price. About the source of money there are two opinions in vogue - some
says the Principal managed the fund from DPI and others say that a local wealthy person with
whom the Principal had good rapport offered the money for the property with the condition that the
hostel therein already would have to be named after his beloved daughter Haimanti demised
untimely. So the hostel was named Haimanti Hindu Hostel where the writer of this article stayed
there for the period 1957 to 1959 as a student of the College.
 
The hostel building was at the centre of large plot of land enclosed by brick wall and
provided with fruit bearing trees of various types and a circular flower garden in the fore-lawn with
water spring head at the centre and majestic wide gate way with wooden doors fitted to tall pillars.
The hostel remained vacant over few years during extremists movement. The DI schools, Nadia,
wandering here and there took advantage of the situation and the office was shifted in the vacant
hostel. When students’ demand for hostel rose again a few years later new hostel was built in a
comparatively inferior environment. This is an example how the interest of education is looked
after by the present authority. This is not all there are many more disgraces befell on the college.
 
Furthermore, a large number of old beautifully designed wooden chairs and tables in the
class rooms and teachers‘ common room was suddenly replaced by ordinary chairs and tables
made of steel frame. Such replacements generated resentments among the teachers and an
enquiry committee was set up by the staff council to enquire into the matter. The findings of the
said committee were submitted to the Principal in writing. But no action has yet been taken. The
controlling authority of Krishnagar Rabindra Bhavan built on the college land in 1961-62 for 
promoting cultural life of college students and of the inhabitants of the Krishnagar City was taken
away from Principal in mid seventy and became afterwards a centre of mainly trade union and
political meetings and conferences. Not only that college play grounds are being used for
political meetings from 1980 onwards. Even class rooms and lecture theatres are being used for
trade union meetings and conferences on Sundays and holidays. The delegates left their plastic or
Sal leaves plates and plastic glasses and cups used for sewing meals and refreshments here and
there in the college campus, making in dirty and unethical. This is not all; there are much more.
 
The ground of the college is now being used as motor training ground; a college building
and its adjoining area is being used as a storing centre of PWD department. Private parties have
been using college grounds for selling stone chips, sand and bricks; small tea stalls have sprung
up here and there. All these activities made the college compound a place of veritable nuisance
which are vitiating academic environment and make further development difficult. The last nail to the
coffin of college development is being driven by the ongoing construction, it is alleged, of sports
complex on the college play grounds destroying the serene natural set up meticulously developed over long period. By whose permission the ongoing construction is going on is not yet clear
to those who are against the construction of sports complex on the College Compound by
extraneous agency. Only the source of fund for the construction is known from the hoarding. The
completion of sports complex and activities therein would definitely destroy not only academic
environment of the college but also natural and aesthetic set up of the college created by founding
fathers for the pursuit of knowledge and for fostering aesthetic sense in the blooming mind of the
students and would be a source of nuisance for the college.
 

Furthermore, the college was black listed by the U.G.C. in March 1975 due to non-
compliance of complete account of a grant given to the college and remained so till 1996 and
thereby the college was deprived of development arid research grants over twenty years. The
black listing was lifted in March 1996 due to sustained pursuance of the case over two years with
U.G.C. and the grants for development, seminars and research works have again started coming
to the college. Recently U.GC. sent NAAC Peer Team for gradation of the college. It is heartening that the NAAC Peer Team has granted ‘Grade A’ status to the college which would come to
help the college for its development in the future.
All these are glaring instances how the infrastructure provided by the forefathers for the
academic benefit for generations to come are being made to shrink day by day by the self
seekers of today. What is going on in the college compound is nothing but sacrilege of sacred
temple of learning and breach of trust of the donors of land for educational purposes. Oh, my
countrymen just see, how we degrade an institution developed by foreign rulers for all out 
development of the inhabitants of Nadia and adjoining districts. It may be remembered here that it is not the best interest of any country to relegate even temporarily educational issues to a position of comparative unimportance as education pays richer dividends in the long run than any other
activity. Exactly this sense of importance of education in social development led the forward 
looking people of Bengal to come forward to establish educational institutions first in the early
stage of British rules.'
